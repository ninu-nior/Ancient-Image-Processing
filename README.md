## Team Members  
- Aditya Mukati (22BCE1310)  
- Nehal Mantri (22BCE5156)  
- Nikhil Joshi (22BCE5075)

## Course Name  
**Digital Image Processing**

## Datasets Used  
We created our own novel datasets for this project, accessible via the following links:  
- [Manuscripts Language Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamukati/manuscripts-language-classification)  
- [OCR Evaluation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityamukati/ocr-eval)

## Main Code  
The core implementation of our project can be found [here](pipeline_with_gui).  
Run `app_tinker.py` for a demonstration.

## Evaluation Notebooks  
Jupyter notebooks containing detailed evaluation results and performance metrics can be accessed [here](JupyterNotebooks).
